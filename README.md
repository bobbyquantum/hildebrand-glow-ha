A Home Assistant custom integration for UK SMETS2 smart meters using the Hildebrand Glow / Bright app API.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Configure through the Home Assistant UI - no YAML required
- **8 Sensors**: Electricity consumption, gas consumption, API costs, calculated daily costs with standing charges
- **Tariff Configuration**: Set your own electricity and gas rates including standing charges
- **Energy Dashboard Compatible**: Works with Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard
- **Auto Updates**: Data refreshes every 5 minutes

## Sensors Created

| Sensor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Electricity Consumption | Daily electricity usage (kWh) |
| Gas Consumption | Daily gas usage (kWh) |
| Electricity Cost (API) | Cost from Glowmarkt API |
| Gas Cost (API) | Cost from Glowmarkt API |
| Electricity Daily Cost | Calculated: (usage × rate) + standing charge |
| Gas Daily Cost | Calculated: (usage × rate) + standing charge |
| Total Daily Energy Cost | Combined electricity + gas costs |
| Daily Standing Charges | Total standing charges |

## Prerequisites

1. A UK SMETS2 smart meter

3. Add **Gas consumption**: `sensor.smart_meter_gas_consumption`
4. Set your tariff rates

## Data Availability

**Important**: Smart meter data from the Glowmarkt API typically has a 24-48 hour delay. The sensors show the most recent available data, which may not be real-time.

For near real-time data, consider using a Glow CAD/IHD device with local MQTT.

## Troubleshooting

### No resources found
- Ensure your Bright app account is properly linked to your smart meter
- Check that you can see data in the Bright mobile app

### Invalid credentials
- Verify your email and password work in the Bright mobile app
- Passwords are case-sensitive

### Sensors showing unavailable
- Check your internet connection
- The Glowmarkt API may be temporarily unavailable
- Check Home Assistant logs for specific error messages
